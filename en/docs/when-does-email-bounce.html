                    <h2>When Does Email Bounce?</h2>
                    <h6 class = 'timestamp'>Last Updated: 6th June, 2024</h6>
                    <p class = 'description'>
                        When an email you send is returned due to an error, it is called a <strong>bounce</strong>.
                        The diagram below illustrates the potential points at which a bounce can occur during the
                        delivery process of an email from your sender's mailbox to the recipient's mailbox.
                    </p>
                    <p class = 'description'>
                        There are three main stages at which a bounce can occur:<br />
                        <a href = '#1'>1. Pre-SMTP Connection</a>, <a href = '#2'>2. During SMTP Session</a>,
                        and <a href = '#3'>3. During Forwarding</a>.

                        In any of these scenarios, a bounce email will be sent to the email address
                        specified in the <span class = 'value'>Return-Path:</span> header of the original email.
                        This bounce email will contain information about the error that caused the delivery failure.
                    </p>

                    When {{ site.html.ss }} decodes bounce emails caused by connection errors, 
                    it categorizes them based on the specific error and the bounce message.
                    The following categories and their corresponding bounce reasons are common:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Expired:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Emails that could not be delivered within a specified timeframe are categorized as
                        <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#expired'>Expired</a></span>.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>HostUnknown:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Emails that bounce due to an invalid or non-existent domain in the recipient's
                        email address are categorized as
                        <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#hostunknown'>HostUnknown</a></span>.
                        This suggests that the domain name specified in the email address does not exist
                        or is not properly configured in DNS.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>NotAccept:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Emails that bounce due to a Null MX record for the recipient's domain are categorized as
                        <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#notaccept'>NotAccept</a></span>.
                        A Null MX record indicates that the recipient's mail server is configured to not accept any email.

                <p class = 'description'>
                    Among the most common causes of pre-SMTP connection error bounces are issues
                    with the authoritative DNS content server for the recipient's email address domain
                    (the part after the @ symbol). In some cases, the DNS server referenced by the
                    sender's mail server may also be malfunctioning. When {{ site.html.ss }} decodes
                    bounce emails returned due to such reasons, the bounce reason is categorized as
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#networkerror'>NetworkError</a></span>.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class = 'row'>
            <div class = 'col-sm-1 col-sm-offset-1'>
                <div class = 'index-label'><i class = 'fas fa-plug'></i></div>
            </div>
            <div class = 'col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-0'>
                <h3 class = 'in-desc'>No Response or Network Error</h3>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    In most cases, these bounces occur due to the recipient's mail server being down or
                    their network's firewall blocking inbound SMTP connections. 
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    However, it is also possible that the sender's network firewall is restricting outbound SMTP connections.
                    In such cases, OP25B (Outbound Port 25 Blocking) implemented by the ISP (Internet Service Provider)
                    might be preventing the connection. Regardless of the cause, these emails are categorized as
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#expired'>Expired</a></span> by {{ site.html.ss }}'s decoding,
                    as they are retried until the network recovers and eventually time out.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class = 'row'>

                <h3 class = 'in-desc'>Non-Existent Domain</h3>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    If the recipient's email address domain does not exist or neither A nor MX records are set,
                    {{ site.html.ss }} will determine the bounce reason as
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#hostunknown'>HostUnknown</a></span>
                    (Hard Bounce). Therefore, please remove the corresponding email address from the sender list
                    as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    In rare cases, if a third party has registered that domain, and has configured their mail server
                    to receive all email addresses for that domain, <strong>there is a risk of unintentional matching
                    with the subscriber names and email addresses listed at the beginning of the email newsletter</strong>,

                    An error <strong>2</strong> in the diagram below illustrates bounces that occur due to
                    errors during the SMTP session after establishing a connection to the recipient's mail server.
                    <strong>These bounces account for approximately 25% of all bounces.</strong>

                <p class = 'description'>
                    In the past, the majority of bounces were caused by errors during the SMTP session.
                    However, <strong>since the phased implementation of bulk sender guidelines by Gmail
                    and Yahoo! starting in February 2024, bounces caused by forwarding emails, particularly
                    those related to domain authentication errors, have become the dominant type.</strong>

                <p class = 'description'>
                    When {{ site.html.ss }} decodes bounce emails occurred during SMTP session, the bounce
                    reason is determined to be related to the recipient's email address or mailbox, such as
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#userunknown'>UserUnknown</a></span>,
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#mailboxfull'>MailboxFull</a></span>, or

                <p class = 'description'>
                    In recent years, there has been an increase in bounces due to stricter domain authentication
                    requirements, resulting in <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#authfailure'>AuthFailure</a></span>
                    bounces. Additionally, bounces related to the reputation of the sender's IP address or domain name
                    can be categorized as <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#badreputation'>BadReputation</a></span>.
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    Other common bounce reasons include <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#requireptr'>RequirePTR</a></span>,
                    which indicates a requirement for proper reverse DNS lookup of the sender's IP address, and

                    which signifies non-compliance with RFC 5322 standards in the email header.

                <p class = 'description'>
                    Similar to the bounces described in the previous section(1), bounce emails resulting

                    <a href = '/#2'>2 (During SMTP Session)</a> above, bounces in this case are generated by
                    <span class = 'value'>mx.example.com</span> in the diagram and sent to the email address
                    specified in the <span class = 'value'>Return-Path:</span> header.

                    When {{ site.html.ss }} decodes bounce emails caused by domain authentication errors
                    during email forwarding, the bounce reason is determined to be
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#authfailure'>AuthFailure</a></span>.

                    If the forwarding server (<span class = 'value'>mx.example.com</span> in the diagram above)
                    supports ARC, ARC-related headers will be added to the email as a technically verifiable
                    record of the fact that <strong>"SPF, DKIM, and DMARC were all OK when we received it,"</strong>
                    which may help the forwarding destination accept the email.
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    Alternatively, if the forwarding server (<span class = 'value'>mx.example.com</span>
                    in the diagram above) IP address has a low reputation and the connection is refused,
                    the bounce reason will be determined to be
                    <span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#badreputation'>BadReputation</a></span>.
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    In recent years, domain authentication-related errors, particularly those related to
                    DMARC and DKIM, have become more prominent. However, bounces caused by nonexistent
                    recipient email addresses 
                    (<span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#userunknown'>UserUnknown</a></span>)
                    and neglected recipient mailboxes 
                    (<span class = 'value'><a href = '/en/reason/#mailboxfull'>MailboxFull</a></span>)
                    are still occurring.
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    Regardless of the bounce reason, if you are sending a significant volume of emails,
                    you should consider removing recipient email addresses that generate errors during
                    email forwarding from your subscribers list.
