                    <p class = 'description'>
                        Bounced Email is a term used to describe an email message that has been rejected by
                        the recipient's email server and returned to the sender due to an error.
                    </p>
                    <p class = 'description'>
                        It is also commonly referred to as <strong>an error email</strong>,
                        <strong>return email</strong>, or <strong>undeliverable email</strong>.
                        Bounce emails are generated for the reasons listed in the 
                        <a href = '/en/reason'>bounce reason list</a>
                        and are returned to the sender with the sender's email address appearing as
                        <span class = 'value'><strong>MAILER-DAEMON</strong></span> or
                        <span class = 'value'><strong>Postmaster</strong></span>.

                <p class = 'description'>
                    Bounced emails exhibit distinctive characteristics in their
                    <span class = 'value'><strong>Subject:</strong></span> headers and
                    <span class = 'value'><strong>From:</strong></span> headers,
                    typically following one of a few common formats or variations.

                <h3 class = 'in-desc'>Subject Headers</h3>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    Bounce emails are automatically generated by the mail server software
                    (Sendmail, Postfix, qmail, etc.) of the sender's or recipient's email server,
                    and the <span class = 'value'>Subject:</span> header of these emails typically
                    follows the following formats:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Returned mail: see transcript for details</li>
                    <li>Mail System Error - Returned Mail</li>
                    <li>Non Delivery Notification</li>
                    <li>DELIVERY FAILURE: ...</li>
                    <li>Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender</li>
                    <li>Postmaster notify: see transcript for details</li>
                    <li>Delivery Status Notification (Failure)</li>
                    <li>Warning: could not send message for past 4 hour</li>
                    <li>failure notice</li>
                </ul>

                <p class = 'description'>
                    Bounced emails typically have a variety of <span class = 'value'>Subject:</span>
                    lines depending on the mail server software, but they all generally convey that
                    there was a delivery error. 

                    Additionally, with the exception of bounce emails generated by some localized mail server software,
                    both the <span class = 'value'>Subject:</span> line and the body of a bounce email are
                    typically written in English.

                <h3 class = 'in-desc'>From Headers</h3>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    Bounced emails are generated by mail server software (Sendmail, Postfix, qmail, etc.)
                    running on the sender's company, organization, or ISP's mail server, 
                    or on the recipient's mail server. 
                    However, the <span class = 'value'>From:</span> header is consistent across all bounce emails,
                    and the email address and name fields typically use the following common names:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>MAILER-DAEMON</li>

                    <li>MAILER-DAEMON@HOSTNAME OF RECIPIENT'S MAIL SERVER</li>
                    <li>Postmaster</li>
                    <li>Postmaster@HOSTNAME OF SENDER'S MAIL SERVER</li>

                <h3 class = 'in-desc'>Message Body</h3>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    The body of a bounced email varies depending on the mail server software and the specific error.
                    While most bounce emails, particularly those from well-known mail server software like Sendmail, Postfix, and qmail,
                    are written in English, some bounce emails from localized mail server software may
                    provide a clear explanation of the error in Japanese.
                </p>
                <p class = 'description'>
                    {{ site.html.ss }} decode headers and the body of bounce emails to determine
                    if they are bounce emails and the reason for the delivery failure.
                    In the body of a bounce email, the error message itself is important,
                    but the following headers are also particularly important:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class = 'value'><strong>Status: 5.1.1</strong></span> &lt;- Various error code</li>
                    <li><span class = 'value'><strong>Diagnostic-Code: ...</strong></span> &lt;- Error message, response of SMTP server, and so on.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class = 'description'>
                    {{ site.html.ss }} is a library which decodes a bounced email, finds a reason of bounce.
